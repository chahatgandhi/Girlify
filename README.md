Problem Statement 2

Every girl around age goes into puberty and till menopause which is generally around 50 face the issue of periods. This is a very natural phenomenon, but still there is a taboo and women don't talk about that and the pads etc. which are must for them are not easily available. So most of the time they compromise and avoid participating in many activities. You have to device an app in such a way so that,

a) Any woman anywhere  and any time, if she needs a pad can simply order the pad for home delivery on the basis of her requirement and timing.

b) Also just as google lets user explore the area, it can also lets user explore it to find the areas where they can easily go and purchase them.(ex like medical stores/ ladies product shops)
 

Basic Idea and Functionality of App

As the problem statement states, issues occur through the whole menstrual cycle which starts from an age of around 13 years or when puberty hits and ends at around at 50, which is also known as Menopause. But open discussion on it is still embarrassing in our societies, a woman facing a problem related to menstrual cycle feels ashamed of it and continues to bear it which creates a big problem. To create awareness among our half population and to make them feel that they are not the only person facing these problems.
We created our app to provide “SUVIDHA” to all the women in our societies . Through our app we tried to facilitate pads and other essential things needed like medicines etc needed at that time of month at their doorstep. Women can consult to Gynecologist experts available 24*7 through the video call option and can communicate to a community facing the same problems as yours and what helped them to cure their problems through FaQ section in our app.

The objective of this page is to provide home delivery of pads to the user at reasonable rates in addition to other necessary medicines.

Consult With Gynecologist: 
This page is designed for users to get perfect guidance in an emergency just one tap call away. It often happens that women get many complications during their periods but they have no one to consult about it due to hesitation. Our app ‘SUVIDHA’ has an objective to provide them with an expert guide on one tap video call, so that they can discuss their issues freely. Our app’s pad delivery page will also help the user to get described medicines by gynecologist as soon as possible.This feature will help users from unnecessary suffering of period time.
